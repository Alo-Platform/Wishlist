# Ālo Platform Wishlist
Welcome to Ālo Reactive Platform!

Ālo is in early development now. We will share more and more details as progress is made.

In the meantime, please share your feature wishes here (by creating Issues) for a truly next-generation reactive actor platform for implementing robust reactive systems.

Ālo simplifies and unifies Actor Model, Real OOP, DDD, DCI, DbC, CQRS, Event-Sourcing & Event-Driven Architecture to realize the original vision of Alan Kay and Carl Hewitt with elegant and modern approaches to build highly scalable, fault-tolerant, self-healing reactive microservices backend and micro-frontend based mobile and web apps with maximum cross-platform code-sharing among client apps.
